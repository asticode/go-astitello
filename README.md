This is a Golang implementation of the DJI Tello SDK.

Up-to-date SDK documentation can be downloaded [here](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/fr/tello/downloads).

Right now this library is compatible with `v1.3.0.0` of SDK ([documentation](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/2d4dce68897a46b19fc717f3576b7c6a/Tello%20%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3/For%20Tello/Tello%20SDK%20Documentation%20EN_1.3_1122.pdf) and [here](https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/Tello/Tello%20SDK%202.0%20User%20Guide.pdf))

# Why should I use this library?

First off, I'd like to say there are very nice DJI Tello libraries out there such as:

- https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/tree/master/platforms/dji/tello
- https://github.com/SMerrony/tello

Unfortunately they seem to rely on reverse-engineering the official app which is undocumented.

If you'd rather use a library that is based on an official documentation, you've come to the right place!
